Many of us have eaten beans, but few of us know that beans come in many varieties, and it's not easy to distinguish between them all because some types have very subtle differences between them. All of this depends on many characteristics.

But what if I gave you data without names for any of these characteristics and without even telling you anything about this data, and you had to understand it on your own and figure out what this data represents, then start working and analyzing based on your conclusions!

This is actually what happened to me in this project, where I was provided with unknown data and had to deal with it, understand it, and figure out what it represents, then design machine learning models to predict the existing classes.

So, I started by identifying the classes and researching what they represent, to discover that they represent names of bean varieties. Then I continued my exciting journey in this project.

A happy journey with the notebook :)
